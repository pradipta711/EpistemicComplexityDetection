fact,1.5,is that soil comes from compost or from poop dung and gets into the system and turns into soil dirt,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1.5,is that mud dries out a bit and Federalist gets into the mud and it dries out some more and it turns into soil ,2.75,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,is that rocks get crushed up and then the sun makes it a little bigger and then compost and dung and then it rains and then its all sunny its complete ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,1,is that the sun makes the mud dry and then when it rains it makes the dried mud mushy and then it turns into soil ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,1,is that mud dries out a bit and fertilizer gets into the mud and it dries out some more and it turns into soil ,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,is that rocks get crushed up and then the sun makes it a little bigger and then compost and dung and then it rains and then it is all sunny its complete ,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,I also think that to be  made soil has to have some dry dirt mud or crushed rock and like wood chips and fertilizer and worms and other things like leafs and sticks and things,2,E-H,L-EF
explanation,2.5,"if worms have eyes my  theory is that they don't because 1 if they did the soil would get into their eyes unless their eyes had see through membranes on them to stop that but that would be to complex for worms
The second reason is that worms are too primitive to have  eyes
Thats why I think that they have a special sense that tells the worms if its light or dark through the heat when its light outside they feel heat and when its dark its cold
  ",4,E-BS,L-EE
fact,2.5,That is probably true because dead animals turn into soil too,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,3.25,I think the rocks should erode first,1,E-S,L-F
fact,0.5,I think that the soil was made by lava,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,2,I think the rocks should erode first,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2,I think that the worms feel heat and the light has heat and dark does not,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,3,worms don't have eyes because they have photo receptors we have those in our spectrophotometers sense the light so the worms can move The light patterns show the worms where to go Heat is in the light and the photo receptors also help them to sense heat ,4,E-S,L-EE
fact,1.75,is that other animals also go 2 on the rocks But also with some compost water and wood chips on it ,2.75,E-H,L-EF

fact,1.5,Most of the soil is made with compost The compost is supposed to be good for the earth,1.75,E-H,L-F
fact,1,is there skin senses that their skin senses the heat and the cold ,1.75,E-H,L-F
explanation,0.5,is that little wood chips are grounded up and worms go into the wood chips and make it fertilized and when it rains the soil recipe is COMPLETE because wood chips are mushy and so is soil So soil must be made from wood chips ,3.5,E-PS,L-E
fact,1,We disagree but agree that the rock is PROBABLY 1000 years old but it STILL gets heated by the sun But we STILL disagree,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,1,is that dung the gets heated by the heat of the sun a rock falls on the dung and the rock melted in the dung Then mud and dirt goes on the start of the soil And then compost comes on the soil and the sun shines on the soil Then it rains Wood chips fall on the start of the soil After that sand falls on the soil then sun mashes it together then worms crawl through it Make a bunch of it and you are DONE ,3.25,E-H,L-E
fact,4,worms breath through their skin and if there is too much light they will get parallelized and harden then they will suffocate,2.25,E-S,L-EF

fact,1,is that you are right because I looked in this book that said soil can come from all most any rock ,2,E-H,L-EF
explanation,1,I am pretty sure that the rocks get all broken is because lots of people step on them making it in to soil and I bet that when worms do number 2 it all so makes soil   ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,3,is that they scene by the light ,1,E-S,L-F
fact,3,i think that they scene the light from there skin and there called photo receptors the worms ignore the red light but for blue and white light they move away from it you really should,2.25,E-S,L-EF
fact,1,is that the soil is made from worms  rocks  soil   ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,the soil is made from rocks it gets all broken up from the wind and getting rain or something watery on it,2.25,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2,soil is getting made all the time the rock gets broken up and turn into sand then it meets up with wood and roots and that is forming SOIL,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,3,i know i know I was tong the rocks get broken by the wind and the rain  winch are one of the most powerful things,3,E-S,L-E
fact,0,is that it is dirty very dirty it is dirty because it is soil,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,1,what type i think any type of rock i think one or a few types of rock or at least each rock makes a different soil ,1.5,E-H,L-F
explanation,2,"I have got three reasons
1 HEAT if you go walking for a day when it is night it is cooler well there is no sun in the night it is the moon the moon is totally okay to look at because it does not have much light well none the sun gives the moon light by shining on the moon and the moon reflects the light on to the earth anyway in the day the sun is shining and its warmer your mom and dad know this that is probably why they make you wear your foodie when you go out for dinner and it is summer maybe worms would wear foodies if they could
2 EYES well maybe worms do have eyes we cannot prove it
3 WEATHER maybe the weather in ways",3,E-BS,L-E
explanation,1.5,of course the animals go pew on the rocks and some times we do too well when you go pee it must do a effect as in when you have to go really bad  and go in a bush that might happen with number two also known as pew I think that wood chips have nothing to do with soil because the wood chips are man made,3,E-H,L-E
explanation,2,is when you put litter in the compost bin you are littering because things in the compost get put in the soil so if you put your candy wrapper that came from the house down the street last Halloween the wrapper will get put in the soil and there it will stay you probably do not care cause your probably enjoying the candy cause compost is banana peels or apple cores that have the left over nutrients in it that go in the soil also they do not hire people to sort through the compost so maybe you should read the sign that goes over the bin saying  COMPOST recycling AND LITTER and after you eat an apple core it can be used in a different way   ,4,E-BS,L-EE
fact,1.5,I do not agree with that because soil is not wood chips It is rock not to be mean oh and Charlotte rocks,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,is SOIL is rock that has been destroyed over 1000000 years And biodegradable trees,1,E-BS,L-F

fact,1,is that dirt is made of bacteria and rocks ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,soil is made of rock and roots and sand,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,1,is that soil comes from tiny of rock bits that have been bashed around ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,2.75,is that soil comes from biodegradable trees and mashed up rocks and pew and lots of biodegradable stuff and circus ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,sail is made 0 biodegradable people in graves,1,E-H,L-F
fact,4,worms don't have eyes they have photometers winch cache the light  and if they go out side to log the preceptors will shot off and the worms will get paralyzed  the worms will not mind red light but hate blue and white light,2.75,E-S,L-EF
fact,1,is that soil is tiny tiny tiny bits of rock ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,is that there would be no earth if it was entirely lava ,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,2,is that worms don't have eyes they can sense the differences  between soil and the outside world Because they can feel the different in misguided  ,3.75,E-BS,L-E
fact,1.5,is that soil comes from biodegradable trees and mashed up rocks and poop and lots of biodegradable stuff and carcass ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,soil is made of biodegradable people in graves,1,E-H,L-F
fact,0.5,is it cooled ,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,2,is that there was a time when the earth was only lava We think that soil was made after that but a lot before the dinosaur times ,2.25,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2.25, is that it is animal Caucasus and compost  ground up rock   ,1.25,E-BS,L-F
fact,1, is that it is animal carcass and compost  ground up rock   ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2.5,adding rocks to it Because soil is made out of rocks,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,is that soil is dirt rocks little bits of water and life The rocks get smashed up Then mix it with the dirt Then add water to make it moist the worms help the soil and the poop and the worms make air holes  ,2.75,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,i disagree because there may be wood chips or there may not I think that there are a little bit of wood chips but not a lot If there rant any wood chips there would probably be a different sore of wood or sticks,1.75,E-BS,L-F
explanation,2,is that it also has something to do with heat Like when you walk into the dark it gets colder because theres less sunlight and when your in light its warmer because theres more sunlight They don't need eyes because they can feel heat like us Light and dark and warm and cold are kind of the same because light is warm and dark is cold  ,3.25,E-BS,L-E
explanation,2,is that rocks get chopped up by feet and other rocks which are rolled over to the other rocks  over time they are chopped into smaller pieces of rock And that repeats until they are tiny pieces Then it rains which makes it nice and moist Then the sun dries it up a little bit You do not want it too dry Then it needs a little air Worms fertilize it And now we have soil soil does not come from any particular place ,3.25,E-BS,L-E
explanation,1.5,is that soil is made out of rocks that get turned into sand then you maybe take a little bit of grounded up wood You take a little water then a little sunshine and there is your soil   ,3,E-H,L-E
explanation,2,is because we have a sense of up and down worms have a sense of light and dark Like when we have been in the dark for a long time when you come out even when your eyes are closed you can still feel the light ,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,1,is that they eat through their mouth ,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,2.5,is that it is rolled over and crushed rock and it needs compost to stay healthy because the compost dissolves and its nutrients does not so it goes in the soil ,3.75,E-BS,L-E
fact,1,is that they are guided by heat ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,is that electro charges are the thing that send out electricity and they bounce off the object and go back ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2,is that photometers see the different between light and dark ,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2.5,igneous rocks are formed while ash falls down volcanoes,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2,is that earthquakes make the plates shift ,1,E-BS,L-F
