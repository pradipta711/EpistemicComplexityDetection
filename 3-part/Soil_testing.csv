fact,2,is that worms have a fifth scene incited of visitation have a six scene incited of five scenes like other living creatures The worms six scene is electro charges  ,2.5,E-H,L-EF
explanation,3,"is that worms have a six sense which is electro
charge sensory This specific sense is the same one that Platypus use to catch its food The way this sense works is every single object on earth has electro charges bouncing off it so when the worm comes it feels the charges so it does not bump into it Since there are so many roots underground this sense comes in handy under there Only certain animals have a six sense like Platypus Worms and many more animals have a six sense  ",2.75,E-H,L-EF

fact,4,And a parasitic one,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1.5," is that they are quite similar cause i think that they are always put together
but i really really do not know why but mold and fungi are always being tailed about  at the same time but   why people always talk about mold and fungi and they are not even similare ",1,E-S,L-F
fact,2,is that fungi usually grows near things And sucks the energy out of it ,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,1,Now that I looked back at My note after I read yours is that I disagree with my self and agree with you   cause now I remember that we had a class discussion together about that  I also remember that it took about like a half hour  And by the way this computers keyboard keeps on coming down when I type because its broken  Also  when I touch this certain button the keyboard can come out  Bye the way Reyna showed Me how to do it   PS  I cannot wait till we start doing the underground research Animals   Bye  Erica,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2.5,is that fungi grows near something that is living and spreads its self on top of it and sucks the energy out of it  ,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,2.5,is that fungi sometimes grows on living things and spreads all over it And then sucks all of the energy out of it and shoots the rest out that they don't need  Then fungi grows bigger over time and so do we when we get energy from living things like plants and protein,4,E-S,L-EE

fact,3,Does Fungi have cells like us I think that because Fungus is living it that it does have cells Well I think ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,3.5,is that Algae isn't exactly Fungi because Algae is a under water Aqua plant And Fungi is known not to be a plant but to be something completely different It has its own kingdom In fact Fungi id closer to a animal then a plant I think that Algae is NOT connected to fungi but is connected to plants my theory is that there are different kinds of under water Fungi and maybe Algae is connected to THAT type of Fungi truly E ,1,E-BS,L-F
explanation,2.5,is that Fungus spreads by expanding and when it is expanded I think that it takes its energy and with the energy it stays like that and over days or hours it stays like that so what I really think is that it takes a long time to spread ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,is that Fungi can actually grow on anything dead or not living ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2.5,is that fungus cant grow on humans so not exactly everything but it can grow on living things like a tree but it usually grows on dead things ,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2.5,"how does Fungi grow and transform How many steps does it take for it to grow Does Fungi have family members that there related to Like from the same family      

is that Fungi are family maybe from the same spores that one may share and start a new  Fungi anatomy And the same thing for under water Fungi ",2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,3.5,"does under water Fungi have a different way of eating or maybe doing what Fungi usually does   


is that since they live in a different habitat maybe they  DO do stuff differently than land Fungi   ���",1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,is that mold is a ripe of Fungus because fungus is a bit more common then moldIn my opinion ,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,3,if Fungi and Could are the same thing    I think that Fungus and mold aren't the same thing because Fungus Does different things and fungus is more living and fungus is more like a Animal and Fungus lives in a Habitat and I just think that their so different from each other that I think they are different things ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,3,is that Could only grows on trees if the tree torts ,1.75,E-H,L-F
fact,3,is that fungus spreads quicker and that it usually grows underground or on  trees then food And I also think that mold grows more on FOOD then on living things like trees ,1.75,E-H,L-F
explanation,4,is that fungus drys because it doesn't have the nutritions it needs Like in that book when in that book it says that fungi needs a cool damp dark surface And if it doesn't get that like its not used to the sun or stuff like that they will have AA better chance of drying up ,3.5,E-PS,L-E
fact,2.5,is that Fungus helps the soil and trees and some Fungi like Mushroom Fungi are eatable and so they give us nutritions and food ,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,1,is that fungus can be contagious by eating it I think that if you eat a poisonous mushroom or a pace of Fungi it is only contagious to you but not anybody else Because its inside you so the mushroom itself is contagious too you So your probably right it may be contagious and it may not ,3.25,E-H,L-E
fact,1.5,is that fungus can grow on dead people and solid objects and I also think that there attracted to non moving things ,2.25,E-S,L-EF
explanation,3,is that fungus feeds the trees that DO Give us air and in that way it helps us have oxygen and air And that relates to how we breath out Carbondale and the trees need that to make air for us and  we keep the trees doing that process and the routine that helps us live So thats like we are trees to them because we give them their air and they give us our air by their air that we give them ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,I think that fudges might give oxygen because it obsess trees by honor,1.75,E-H,L-F
fact,2,I think that fungus grows on living things yes because  thats how it starts out   ,1.5,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,I do not think so because Ive touch a tree that has fungus on it it did not come on to me ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,fungus etch dead thing not grow on them,2.25,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,fungi and fungus is piratically the same thing   because fungi etch what eve its on sow does fungus but mi us geeing,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,I think so to I ha seen mold on blue sees ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,2,is that fungus mushrooms give trees minerals and the tree gives the fungi mushrooms sugar ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,how does fungi help the planet I think it helps the trees grow,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1, I think that it takes a week or more for fungi to spread I think that fungi spreads to eat and to get energy,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1.5, I think that fungus is basically mold because they look the same  there both the same ripe,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2,I think fungus is a related to mold  like there in the same family there in a family,2.25,E-H,L-EF
fact,2, I disagree fungi is related to mold they look the same and there in the same family,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,how does fungi help the planet I think it helps the trees grow,1.25,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,I think that fungus is not contagious because vie held fungi for a minutes and nothing ha pend but I think it spreads,1,E-S,L-F
fact,3,Beatles racy the spots to other places,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,3,is once a fungus is made it  keeps  eating and it get bigger and  speeds ,2.25,E-H,L-EF
fact,2.5,is that  fungus will grow  on living thing such as  a tree But I am not so sure about  non living  things,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,3, is fungus and mold are similar because  fungus will grow on living and nonliving things and mold will grow on nonliving and  some living things  such as  tree ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,4, Why mold changes  color as it ages   As it gets more air it changes color,3,E-H,L-E
fact,1,is stiff is right because  fungus  can sored from a little thing to a big thing,1,E-S,L-F
explanation,2,  I think that if fungi spreads too much then something will happen to the planet it will have to much fungi then it might share and spread with the mold then it maybe be covered with land and something might happen and since most fungi are very different from the others they might connect with the others then it with be bigger and bigger and it will be like a new kind of fungi because they join up together like a community,2.25,E-S,L-EF
fact,1, I think fungi can grow on you because if you get sick then it might grow on you but likely it wont grow on you,1,E-H,L-F
fact,3, i think fungus grows like this it starts it starts with the sprout and gets bigger and bigger and forms into fungi,2.25,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1, what i think fungi is i think it is a kind of mold but a little different mold and not the same color,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2, i think that fungi does help the world because if we did not have fungi then the bugs and insects would not have shelter and food like cheese blue cheese is fungus,3,E-S,L-E
fact,2.5, i think fungi helps the world because if we didn't have fungi than we wouldn't have a lot of food,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,1,"If your lucky it may not grow on you
but if you have a tiny spot of fungi it can spread",1.5,E-H,L-F
fact,1,because fungi spread like animals But animals don't spread that will be Marseillaise but instead they walk ,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,2,"yes well sometimes I think many if its really old
or if its a certain ripe but I no that it can grow on a bug",3,E-H,L-E
fact,1,is Fungus dose not go on people it grows on stuff like a toy  food you know stuff well fungus grow on people because dead skin is fungus,4,E-BS,L-EE
fact,1.5,Where does fungus grow  is   you eat cheese and mushroom pizza the cheese is mold and mushrooms are fungi All cheeses might be fungus Its just    theory   My theory  is  fungus is a family with mold and moss Fungus can spread grow and add on to different things Like stale  bread Fungus like mold spreads over the top of the fungus Once me and my dad baked banana bread and I put oranges around the bread and after a few days the oranges grew fungus,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,2,and know how fungi spreads along cool forests misty jungles soils and grounds I have a theory though Fungi eats and then it can spread faster because there is more room to sped   Every day fungi lieus for food so it can spread even more each day   Its like when fungi spreads its getting more power to spread any place it needs or has to spread to a new and different place to how Fungus has different kind of fungus like mushroom or mold   Why does fungus relate to mold And IS mushrooms   is that they may has a relation but Ill never understand why they are related I don't know why mushrooms are fungus And why mushrooms has spots too Most mushrooms are plain but purple red or whiter white or brown If there are different colors Id like to know,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,"I think that soil and fungi are related And that start mating Its Like making a new baby

   WY dews fungus grow on soil",1.25,E-H,L-F
