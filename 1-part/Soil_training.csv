fact,1.5,is that soil comes from compost or from poop dung and gets into the system and turns into soil dirt,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1.5,is that mud dries out a bit and Federalist gets into the mud and it dries out some more and it turns into soil ,2.75,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,is that rocks get crushed up and then the sun makes it a little bigger and then compost and dung and then it rains and then its all sunny its complete ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,1,is that the sun makes the mud dry and then when it rains it makes the dried mud mushy and then it turns into soil ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,1,is that mud dries out a bit and fertilizer gets into the mud and it dries out some more and it turns into soil ,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,is that rocks get crushed up and then the sun makes it a little bigger and then compost and dung and then it rains and then it is all sunny its complete ,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,I also think that to be  made soil has to have some dry dirt mud or crushed rock and like wood chips and fertilizer and worms and other things like leafs and sticks and things,2,E-H,L-EF
explanation,2.5,"if worms have eyes my  theory is that they don't because 1 if they did the soil would get into their eyes unless their eyes had see through membranes on them to stop that but that would be to complex for worms
The second reason is that worms are too primitive to have  eyes
Thats why I think that they have a special sense that tells the worms if its light or dark through the heat when its light outside they feel heat and when its dark its cold
  ",4,E-BS,L-EE
fact,2.5,That is probably true because dead animals turn into soil too,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,3.25,I think the rocks should erode first,1,E-S,L-F
fact,0.5,I think that the soil was made by lava,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,2,I think the rocks should erode first,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2,I think that the worms feel heat and the light has heat and dark does not,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,3,worms don't have eyes because they have photo receptors we have those in our spectrophotometers sense the light so the worms can move The light patterns show the worms where to go Heat is in the light and the photo receptors also help them to sense heat ,4,E-S,L-EE
fact,1.75,is that other animals also go 2 on the rocks But also with some compost water and wood chips on it ,2.75,E-H,L-EF
fact,2.5,is that it has compost too ,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2.5,is that the rocks DO and will ALWAYS get ground up before it turns into soil ,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2,Is that they have a sense of the light of light and dark They feel heat in the light and they feel coolness when there in the dark ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2.5,is that soil comes from dung worms wood chips compost rocks and worm 2  ,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,is that other animals also go 2 on the rocks But also with some compost water and wood chips on it ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,is that soil is mostly made of Rocks Dirt compost and Dung ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,is that worms do not have eyes they sense their feeling ,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,is that soil is made from broken up pieces of wood roots and dirt Water will be added later on making the soil mushy Then there will be the fertilizer helping all the plants grow  ,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,is that Soil is covered ALL over the earth but it can get polluted and flooded ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,is that there  is also dung and compost too ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,I think that some rocks still remains as little particles Other is sand,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1.5,Most of the soil is made with compost The compost is supposed to be good for the earth,1.75,E-H,L-F
fact,1,is there skin senses that their skin senses the heat and the cold ,1.75,E-H,L-F
explanation,0.5,is that little wood chips are grounded up and worms go into the wood chips and make it fertilized and when it rains the soil recipe is COMPLETE because wood chips are mushy and so is soil So soil must be made from wood chips ,3.5,E-PS,L-E
fact,1,We disagree but agree that the rock is PROBABLY 1000 years old but it STILL gets heated by the sun But we STILL disagree,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,1,is that dung the gets heated by the heat of the sun a rock falls on the dung and the rock melted in the dung Then mud and dirt goes on the start of the soil And then compost comes on the soil and the sun shines on the soil Then it rains Wood chips fall on the start of the soil After that sand falls on the soil then sun mashes it together then worms crawl through it Make a bunch of it and you are DONE ,3.25,E-H,L-E
fact,4,worms breath through their skin and if there is too much light they will get parallelized and harden then they will suffocate,2.25,E-S,L-EF
fact,1,is that when it gets really cold the rocks get smaller and then it becomes soil i saw it on a website  ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,1.5,is that soil is made of many other things like dead bugs and there are some Caucasus in there but most of them get eaten by bugs  ,1.75,E-H,L-F
fact,2.5,is that worms might have eyes because they can probably scene light and dark and there other scenes they use more than sight but they probably have sight but its not really good    ,1.5,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,I agree that when people step on the rocks that it crushes them but maybe over the years they get all crushed up to ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,is that the worms have something in them they sense that when its warm its day time and when its cold its night time,2.25,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2,is that other animals but I Don think that there are wood chips ,1,E-BS,L-F
explanation,1.5,I think there is a rock and over 1000s of years it decomposes and then worms pew on it and it turns into soil,3,E-H,L-E
fact,2.5,is that when worms dig in the soil and let plants roots in and also water,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,I think there is a rock and over 1000s of years it decomposes and then worms poop on it and it turns into soil,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,is that other animals but I do not think that there are wood chips ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,is that they feel that it is cold and when it is light they feel hot ,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,is that the plates move because when the planets move they force the plates to move ,2.25,E-H,L-EF
fact,1.5,is that the rocks break down into sand and old pieces of wood come from dead trees and there are also roots from dead plants also go into the mixture and then it makes soil ,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,is that worms react to white and blue lights but red doe sent bother them ,1.25,E-BS,L-F
fact,3,is that worms breath through their skin and don't have noses or eyes and ears ,1,E-S,L-F
explanation,2,is that there was a rock and over 1000s of years it decomposes and 1000s of years later the rock turns into soil ,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,1,is that they feel the brightness of the moon and then since the moon is so bright they feel the light and then they know its day time,2.25,E-H,L-EF
fact,0.5,is that soil is made of grass and wormy turds,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,1,is that you are right because I looked in this book that said soil can come from all most any rock ,2,E-H,L-EF
explanation,1,I am pretty sure that the rocks get all broken is because lots of people step on them making it in to soil and I bet that when worms do number 2 it all so makes soil   ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,3,is that they scene by the light ,1,E-S,L-F
fact,3,i think that they scene the light from there skin and there called photo receptors the worms ignore the red light but for blue and white light they move away from it you really should,2.25,E-S,L-EF
fact,1,is that the soil is made from worms  rocks  soil   ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,the soil is made from rocks it gets all broken up from the wind and getting rain or something watery on it,2.25,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2,soil is getting made all the time the rock gets broken up and turn into sand then it meets up with wood and roots and that is forming SOIL,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,3,i know i know I was tong the rocks get broken by the wind and the rain  winch are one of the most powerful things,3,E-S,L-E
fact,0,is that it is dirty very dirty it is dirty because it is soil,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,1,what type i think any type of rock i think one or a few types of rock or at least each rock makes a different soil ,1.5,E-H,L-F
explanation,2,"I have got three reasons
1 HEAT if you go walking for a day when it is night it is cooler well there is no sun in the night it is the moon the moon is totally okay to look at because it does not have much light well none the sun gives the moon light by shining on the moon and the moon reflects the light on to the earth anyway in the day the sun is shining and its warmer your mom and dad know this that is probably why they make you wear your foodie when you go out for dinner and it is summer maybe worms would wear foodies if they could
2 EYES well maybe worms do have eyes we cannot prove it
3 WEATHER maybe the weather in ways",3,E-BS,L-E
explanation,1.5,of course the animals go pew on the rocks and some times we do too well when you go pee it must do a effect as in when you have to go really bad  and go in a bush that might happen with number two also known as pew I think that wood chips have nothing to do with soil because the wood chips are man made,3,E-H,L-E
explanation,2,is when you put litter in the compost bin you are littering because things in the compost get put in the soil so if you put your candy wrapper that came from the house down the street last Halloween the wrapper will get put in the soil and there it will stay you probably do not care cause your probably enjoying the candy cause compost is banana peels or apple cores that have the left over nutrients in it that go in the soil also they do not hire people to sort through the compost so maybe you should read the sign that goes over the bin saying  COMPOST recycling AND LITTER and after you eat an apple core it can be used in a different way   ,4,E-BS,L-EE
fact,1.5,I do not agree with that because soil is not wood chips It is rock not to be mean oh and Charlotte rocks,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,is SOIL is rock that has been destroyed over 1000000 years And biodegradable trees,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1.5,is SOIL is made of groined up soil and biodegradable trees ,1.25,E-H,L-F
fact,3,earthworms don't have lungs they  breath through there skin,1,E-S,L-F
fact,1,is that they little electric charges ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,is that sand is only chopped rocks soil is chopped rocks and biodegradable trees ,1.25,E-H,L-F
fact,1.5,is SOIL is made of grounded up soil and biodegradable trees ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,is that dirt is made of bacteria and rocks ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,soil is made of rock and roots and sand,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,1,is that soil comes from tiny of rock bits that have been bashed around ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,2.75,is that soil comes from biodegradable trees and mashed up rocks and pew and lots of biodegradable stuff and circus ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,sail is made 0 biodegradable people in graves,1,E-H,L-F
fact,4,worms don't have eyes they have photometers winch cache the light  and if they go out side to log the preceptors will shot off and the worms will get paralyzed  the worms will not mind red light but hate blue and white light,2.75,E-S,L-EF
fact,1,is that soil is tiny tiny tiny bits of rock ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,is that there would be no earth if it was entirely lava ,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,2,is that worms don't have eyes they can sense the differences  between soil and the outside world Because they can feel the different in misguided  ,3.75,E-BS,L-E
fact,1.5,is that soil comes from biodegradable trees and mashed up rocks and poop and lots of biodegradable stuff and carcass ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,soil is made of biodegradable people in graves,1,E-H,L-F
fact,0.5,is it cooled ,1,E-PS,L-F
fact,2,is that there was a time when the earth was only lava We think that soil was made after that but a lot before the dinosaur times ,2.25,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2.25, is that it is animal Caucasus and compost  ground up rock   ,1.25,E-BS,L-F
fact,1, is that it is animal carcass and compost  ground up rock   ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2.5,adding rocks to it Because soil is made out of rocks,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,is that soil is dirt rocks little bits of water and life The rocks get smashed up Then mix it with the dirt Then add water to make it moist the worms help the soil and the poop and the worms make air holes  ,2.75,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,i disagree because there may be wood chips or there may not I think that there are a little bit of wood chips but not a lot If there rant any wood chips there would probably be a different sore of wood or sticks,1.75,E-BS,L-F
explanation,2,is that it also has something to do with heat Like when you walk into the dark it gets colder because theres less sunlight and when your in light its warmer because theres more sunlight They don't need eyes because they can feel heat like us Light and dark and warm and cold are kind of the same because light is warm and dark is cold  ,3.25,E-BS,L-E
explanation,2,is that rocks get chopped up by feet and other rocks which are rolled over to the other rocks  over time they are chopped into smaller pieces of rock And that repeats until they are tiny pieces Then it rains which makes it nice and moist Then the sun dries it up a little bit You do not want it too dry Then it needs a little air Worms fertilize it And now we have soil soil does not come from any particular place ,3.25,E-BS,L-E
explanation,1.5,is that soil is made out of rocks that get turned into sand then you maybe take a little bit of grounded up wood You take a little water then a little sunshine and there is your soil   ,3,E-H,L-E
explanation,2,is because we have a sense of up and down worms have a sense of light and dark Like when we have been in the dark for a long time when you come out even when your eyes are closed you can still feel the light ,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,1,is that they eat through their mouth ,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,2.5,is that it is rolled over and crushed rock and it needs compost to stay healthy because the compost dissolves and its nutrients does not so it goes in the soil ,3.75,E-BS,L-E
fact,1,is that they are guided by heat ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,is that electro charges are the thing that send out electricity and they bounce off the object and go back ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2,is that photometers see the different between light and dark ,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2.5,igneous rocks are formed while ash falls down volcanoes,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2,is that earthquakes make the plates shift ,1,E-BS,L-F
fact,2,is that worms have a fifth scene incited of visitation have a six scene incited of five scenes like other living creatures The worms six scene is electro charges  ,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,3,"is that worms have a six sense which is electro
charge sensory This specific sense is the same one that Platypus use to catch its food The way this sense works is every single object on earth has electro charges bouncing off it so when the worm comes it feels the charges so it does not bump into it Since there are so many roots underground this sense comes in handy under there Only certain animals have a six sense like Platypus Worms and many more animals have a six sense  ",3.5,E-S,L-E
fact,1, I think the most comment kind of fungus is house moldboard I see it a lot And it is in my house After that I would think poisoning mushrooms in your garden,2.5,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,i don't think mold is quartet the same as mold because fungus can grow on living things and big things and mold can only grow on food and dead thing s as far as i know ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1, is that fungus  is mostly underground and the older it gets the thicker it gets       ,1.5,E-H,L-F
explanation,2,is that fungus has a special ingredient in it Most food that when is left out to long dies in a way and when it dies it gets exposed to fungus's special ingredient and fungus takes it over,3.5,E-BS,L-E
explanation,2,is that fungus lives mostly on non living things but it can grow on living things i also think that fungus grows on dead people and eats at it and thats part of the reason that humans desiderata because they get eaten up ,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,2.5,is that fungus is outside and mold is inside ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,4,And a parasitic one,1,E-S,L-F
fact,1.5," is that they are quite similar cause i think that they are always put together
but i really really do not know why but mold and fungi are always being tailed about  at the same time but   why people always talk about mold and fungi and they are not even similare ",2,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,is that fungi usually grows near things And sucks the energy out of it ,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,Now that I looked back at My note after I read yours is that I disagree with my self and agree with you   cause now I remember that we had a class discussion together about that  I also remember that it took about like a half hour  And by the way this computers keyboard keeps on coming down when I type because its broken  Also  when I touch this certain button the keyboard can come out  Bye the way Reyna showed Me how to do it   PS  I cannot wait till we start doing the underground research Animals   Bye  Erica,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2.5,is that fungi grows near something that is living and spreads its self on top of it and sucks the energy out of it  ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,2.5,is that fungi sometimes grows on living things and spreads all over it And then sucks all of the energy out of it and shoots the rest out that they don't need  Then fungi grows bigger over time and so do we when we get energy from living things like plants and protein,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,2.5,is that spreading is fungus instinct like talking is ours ,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,4,fungus has a symbiotic relationship with the rest of nature,1,E-S,L-F
fact,2,is that fungi needs time to grow for a few days So if you leave your finger there for a few years or months it would probably grow on your finger ,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,3,Does Fungi have cells like us I think that because Fungus is living it that it does have cells Well I think ,2,E-S,L-EF
explanation,3.5,is that Algae isn't exactly Fungi because Algae is a under water Aqua plant And Fungi is known not to be a plant but to be something completely different It has its own kingdom In fact Fungi id closer to a animal then a plant I think that Algae is NOT connected to fungi but is connected to plants my theory is that there are different kinds of under water Fungi and maybe Algae is connected to THAT type of Fungi truly E ,4,E-S,L-EE
explanation,2.5,is that Fungus spreads by expanding and when it is expanded I think that it takes its energy and with the energy it stays like that and over days or hours it stays like that so what I really think is that it takes a long time to spread ,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,1,is that Fungi can actually grow on anything dead or not living ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2.5,is that fungus cant grow on humans so not exactly everything but it can grow on living things like a tree but it usually grows on dead things ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2.5,"how does Fungi grow and transform How many steps does it take for it to grow Does Fungi have family members that there related to Like from the same family      

is that Fungi are family maybe from the same spores that one may share and start a new  Fungi anatomy And the same thing for under water Fungi ",2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,3.5,"does under water Fungi have a different way of eating or maybe doing what Fungi usually does   


is that since they live in a different habitat maybe they  DO do stuff differently than land Fungi   ���",2,E-S,L-EF
fact,2,is that mold is a ripe of Fungus because fungus is a bit more common then moldIn my opinion ,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,3,if Fungi and Could are the same thing    I think that Fungus and mold aren't the same thing because Fungus Does different things and fungus is more living and fungus is more like a Animal and Fungus lives in a Habitat and I just think that their so different from each other that I think they are different things ,3,E-S,L-E
fact,3,is that Could only grows on trees if the tree torts ,2,E-S,L-EF
fact,3,is that fungus spreads quicker and that it usually grows underground or on  trees then food And I also think that mold grows more on FOOD then on living things like trees ,2.5,E-S,L-EF
explanation,4,is that fungus drys because it doesn't have the nutritions it needs Like in that book when in that book it says that fungi needs a cool damp dark surface And if it doesn't get that like its not used to the sun or stuff like that they will have AA better chance of drying up ,3,E-S,L-E
fact,2.5,is that Fungus helps the soil and trees and some Fungi like Mushroom Fungi are eatable and so they give us nutritions and food ,2,E-BS,L-EF
explanation,1,is that fungus can be contagious by eating it I think that if you eat a poisonous mushroom or a pace of Fungi it is only contagious to you but not anybody else Because its inside you so the mushroom itself is contagious too you So your probably right it may be contagious and it may not ,3,E-H,L-E
fact,1.5,is that fungus can grow on dead people and solid objects and I also think that there attracted to non moving things ,2,E-H,L-EF
explanation,3,is that fungus feeds the trees that DO Give us air and in that way it helps us have oxygen and air And that relates to how we breath out Carbondale and the trees need that to make air for us and  we keep the trees doing that process and the routine that helps us live So thats like we are trees to them because we give them their air and they give us our air by their air that we give them ,4,E-S,L-EE
fact,2,I think that fudges might give oxygen because it obsess trees by honor,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2,I think that fungus grows on living things yes because  thats how it starts out   ,1.5,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,I do not think so because Ive touch a tree that has fungus on it it did not come on to me ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,fungus etch dead thing not grow on them,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,fungi and fungus is piratically the same thing   because fungi etch what eve its on sow does fungus but mi us geeing,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,I think so to I ha seen mold on blue sees ,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,2,is that fungus mushrooms give trees minerals and the tree gives the fungi mushrooms sugar ,2.5,E-BS,L-EF
fact,1,how does fungi help the planet I think it helps the trees grow,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1, I think that it takes a week or more for fungi to spread I think that fungi spreads to eat and to get energy,1.5,E-H,L-F
fact,1.5, I think that fungus is basically mold because they look the same  there both the same ripe,1.5,E-H,L-F
fact,2,I think fungus is a related to mold  like there in the same family there in a family,1.5,E-BS,L-F
fact,2, I disagree fungi is related to mold they look the same and there in the same family,1.5,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,how does fungi help the planet I think it helps the trees grow,1,E-H,L-F
fact,1,I think that fungus is not contagious because vie held fungi for a minutes and nothing ha pend but I think it spreads,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,3,Beatles racy the spots to other places,1,E-S,L-F
fact,3,is once a fungus is made it  keeps  eating and it get bigger and  speeds ,1,E-S,L-F
fact,2.5,is that  fungus will grow  on living thing such as  a tree But I am not so sure about  non living  things,1.5,E-BS,L-F
fact,3, is fungus and mold are similar because  fungus will grow on living and nonliving things and mold will grow on nonliving and  some living things  such as  tree ,2,E-S,L-EF
fact,4, Why mold changes  color as it ages   As it gets more air it changes color,1,E-S,L-F
fact,1,is stiff is right because  fungus  can sored from a little thing to a big thing,1,E-H,L-F
explanation,2,  I think that if fungi spreads too much then something will happen to the planet it will have to much fungi then it might share and spread with the mold then it maybe be covered with land and something might happen and since most fungi are very different from the others they might connect with the others then it with be bigger and bigger and it will be like a new kind of fungi because they join up together like a community,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,1, I think fungi can grow on you because if you get sick then it might grow on you but likely it wont grow on you,2,E-H,L-EF
fact,3, i think fungus grows like this it starts it starts with the sprout and gets bigger and bigger and forms into fungi,1.5,E-S,L-F
fact,1, what i think fungi is i think it is a kind of mold but a little different mold and not the same color,1.5,E-H,L-F
fact,2, i think that fungi does help the world because if we did not have fungi then the bugs and insects would not have shelter and food like cheese blue cheese is fungus,2,E-BS,L-EF
fact,2.5, i think fungi helps the world because if we didn't have fungi than we wouldn't have a lot of food,1.5,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,"If your lucky it may not grow on you
but if you have a tiny spot of fungi it can spread",1.5,E-H,L-F
fact,1,because fungi spread like animals But animals don't spread that will be Marseillaise but instead they walk ,1,E-H,L-F
fact,2,"yes well sometimes I think many if its really old
or if its a certain ripe but I no that it can grow on a bug",1,E-BS,L-F
fact,1,is Fungus dose not go on people it grows on stuff like a toy  food you know stuff well fungus grow on people because dead skin is fungus,1.5,E-H,L-F
fact,1.5,Where does fungus grow  is   you eat cheese and mushroom pizza the cheese is mold and mushrooms are fungi All cheeses might be fungus Its just    theory   My theory  is  fungus is a family with mold and moss Fungus can spread grow and add on to different things Like stale  bread Fungus like mold spreads over the top of the fungus Once me and my dad baked banana bread and I put oranges around the bread and after a few days the oranges grew fungus,2.5,E-H,L-EF
explanation,2,and know how fungi spreads along cool forests misty jungles soils and grounds I have a theory though Fungi eats and then it can spread faster because there is more room to sped   Every day fungi lieus for food so it can spread even more each day   Its like when fungi spreads its getting more power to spread any place it needs or has to spread to a new and different place to how Fungus has different kind of fungus like mushroom or mold   Why does fungus relate to mold And IS mushrooms   is that they may has a relation but Ill never understand why they are related I don't know why mushrooms are fungus And why mushrooms has spots too Most mushrooms are plain but purple red or whiter white or brown If there are different colors Id like to know,3,E-BS,L-E
fact,1,"I think that soil and fungi are related And that start mating Its Like making a new baby

   WY dews fungus grow on soil",2,E-H,L-EF
fact,1,I agree because if it did you wold suffocate,1.5,E-H,L-F
